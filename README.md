**Instructions**

1. Make sure you have python installed.

2. Download the `input.txt` file. This contains the dates, which you have been active. To get that, go to your Roblox DevForum profile.
3. Then go to activity, and click on the `Download All` button.

4. Once that downloads, look in the downloaded folder, and look for `Visits.csv`. Then in the first column, you will see the `visited_at` column.
5. Select everything in that column aside from the title line (obviously).
6. Now paste that over my dates, (my dates are there to show you what the format should look like, (the dates will be different))

7. You could make a folder to make this a little bit easier, but it is not required.
8. Now download the `main.py` script, and put it in said folder, along with the newly refurbished `input.txt`.

9. Now all you have to do is, open your IDE, and run the script.
